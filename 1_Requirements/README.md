# Problem Statement : 
           Now a days elections are going in schools and colleges for leadership so during that period the manual voting will be very difficult in pandamic situation 
   like they will be afraid of corona virus which is spreading like anything so they hesitste to come to school or college and vote.
# What i am going to do is :
          createing the online VOTING MACHINE so that they can do their voting in their home only by giving their their voter ID.
# I will be completing this project within 31 march.
# This project(Voting Machine) can be used by the colleges or schools for the election.
# How it works :
           * First it will ask the User name and password if it matches then the actuall process will start.
           * It will ask u the option that how many members are standing for election and their respective representative symbol.
           * Then for the voters it will ask voting ID so that they can know who voted to whom.
            * At last will give u four option
